Update Map Coordinates

This script updates the coordinates of overworld maps to be relative to Pallet Town.
It starts with Pallet Town (map_id 1) at coordinates (0,0) and recursively updates
connected maps based on their map connections.

Coordinate System:
- Pallet Town's top-left tile is at (0,0)
- For maps to the north, y coordinates are negative with no overlap
  (e.g., Route 1's bottom row is at y=-1, its top row is at y=-36)
- For maps further north (like Viridian City), coordinates continue to decrease
  (e.g., Viridian City's bottom row is at y=-37, just above Route 1's top row)
- For maps to the south, y coordinates are positive and start at Pallet Town's height
- For maps to the west, x coordinates are negative with no overlap
- For maps to the east, x coordinates are positive and start at Pallet Town's width

This ensures there's no overlap between adjacent maps.

The script processes all overworld maps, starting with Pallet Town and branching out
to adjacent maps based on the map_connections table. The maps are processed in
breadth-first order, ensuring that each map's coordinates are updated relative to
its connected maps that have already been processed.
